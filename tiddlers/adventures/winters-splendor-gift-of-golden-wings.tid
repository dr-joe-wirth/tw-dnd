Singing or reciting the lyrics to Golden Wings takes <<time 1m>>. If a good-aligned character casts [[Find Familiar]] after making a successful <<performance 15>>, they may summon a celestial gold <<mob Pseudodragon>> to serve as their familiar. This creature is lawful good and abandons the character if they ever willingly harm a celestial.
