While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain). unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. ''At the DM's option'', climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful ''Strength (Athletics) check''. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
