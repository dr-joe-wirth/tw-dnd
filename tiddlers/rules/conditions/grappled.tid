* A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is [[Incapacitated]] (see the condition).
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the [[Thunderwave]] spell.
