These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5 foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding oneâ€™s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
