Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponentâ€™s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 [[Ki]] point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
