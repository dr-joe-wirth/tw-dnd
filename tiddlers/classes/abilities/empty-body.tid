Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 [[Ki]] points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 [[Ki]] points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you canâ€™t take any other creatures with you.
