At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being [[Frightened]] or [[Charmed]]. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are [[Incapacitated]] or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
