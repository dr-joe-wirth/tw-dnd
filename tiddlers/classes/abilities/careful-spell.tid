When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spellâ€™s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.
