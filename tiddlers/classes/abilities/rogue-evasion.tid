Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragonâ€™s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
