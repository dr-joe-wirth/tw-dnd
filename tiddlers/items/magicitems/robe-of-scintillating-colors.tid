This robe has 3 charges, and it regains <<roll 1d3>> expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds <<bright 30>> and an additional <<dim 30>>. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robeâ€™s power is activated must succeed on a <<save Wis 15>> or become [[Stunned]] until the effect ends.
