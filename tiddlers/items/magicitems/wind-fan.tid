While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the [[Gust of Wind]] spell (<<save "Spell DC" 13>>) from it. Once used, the fan shouldnâ€™t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
