You can use a bonus action to speak this magic swordâ€™s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed <<bright 40>> and an additional <<dim 40>>. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra <<fire 2d6>> to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
