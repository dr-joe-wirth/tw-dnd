While lit, this hooded lantern burns for <<time 6h>> on 1 pint of oil, shedding <<bright 30>> and an additional <<dim 30>>. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lanternâ€™s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.
