This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a <<save Dex 15>> or become [[Restrained]].

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target [[Restrained]] by the rope can use an action to make a <<skillcheck "Str or Dex" 15>> (targetâ€™s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer [[Restrained]] by the rope.

The rope has <<ac 20>> and <<hp 20>>. It regains <<heal 1>> every <<time 5m>> as long as it has at least <<hp 1>>. If the rope drops to <<hp 0>>, it is destroyed.
