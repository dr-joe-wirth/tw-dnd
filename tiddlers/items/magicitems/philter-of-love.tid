The next time you see a creature within <<time 10m>> after drinking this philter, you become [[Charmed]] by that creature for <<time 1h>>. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potionâ€™s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
