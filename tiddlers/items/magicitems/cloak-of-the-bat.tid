While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of <<dim>> or <<darkness>>, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak’s edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in <<dim>> or <<darkness>>, you lose this flying speed.

While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast [[Polymorph]] on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
