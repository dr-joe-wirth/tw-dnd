This crystal ball is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [[Scrying]] spell (<<save "Spell DC" 17>>) with it.

While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [[Suggestion]] spell (<<save "Spell DC" 17>>) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [[Suggestion]] to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[Scrying]] ends. Once used, the [[Suggestion]] power of the crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.
