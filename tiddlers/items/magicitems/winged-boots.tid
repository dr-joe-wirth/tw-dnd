While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to <<time 4h>>, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of <<time 1m>> from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The boots regain <<time 2h>> of flying capability for every <<time 12h>> they arenâ€™t in use.
