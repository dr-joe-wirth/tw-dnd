This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains <<roll 1d4+1>> doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains <<heal 2d8+2>>, ceases to be [[Poisoned]], and is cured of any disease.
