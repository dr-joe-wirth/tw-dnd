This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[Oil of Slipperiness]]. When found, a container contains <<roll 1d6+1>> ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes <<time 1m>> to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [[Universal Solvent]] or [[Oil of Etherealness]], or with a [[Wish]] spell.
