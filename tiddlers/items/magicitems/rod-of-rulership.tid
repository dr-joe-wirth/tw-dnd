You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a <<save Wis 15>> or be [[Charmed]] by you for <<time 8h>>. While [[Charmed]] in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
