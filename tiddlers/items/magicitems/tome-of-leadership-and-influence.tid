This book contains guidelines for influencing and charming others, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend <<time 48h>> over a period of <<time "&le;6d">> studying the bookâ€™s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Charisma score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
