This necklace has <<roll 1d6+3>> beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level [[Fireball]] spell (<<save "Spell DC" 15>>).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the [[Fireball]] by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
