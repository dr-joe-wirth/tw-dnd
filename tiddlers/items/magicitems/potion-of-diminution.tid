When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the [[Enlarge/Reduce]] spell for <<roll 1d4>> hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
