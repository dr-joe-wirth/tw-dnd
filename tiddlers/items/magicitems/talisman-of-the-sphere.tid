When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to control a [[Sphere of Annihilation]] while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a sphere of annihilation, you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 Ã— your Intelligence modifier.
