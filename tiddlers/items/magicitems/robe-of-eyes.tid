This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

* The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
* You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
* You can see [[Invisible]] creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.

The eyes on the robe canâ€™t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.

A [[Light]] spell cast on the robe or a [[Daylight]] spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be [[Blinded]] for <<time 1m>>. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a <<save Con 11>> for [[Light]] or <<save Con 15>> for [[Daylight]], ending the blindness on a success.
