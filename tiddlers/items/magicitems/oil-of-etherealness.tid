Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment itâ€™s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes <<time 10m>>. The affected creature then gains the effect of the [[Etherealness]] spell for <<time 1h>>.
