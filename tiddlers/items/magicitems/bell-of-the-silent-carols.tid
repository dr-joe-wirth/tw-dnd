This is a customized [[Horn of Silent Alarm]].

This bell has 4 charges. When you use an action to shake it, one creature of your choice can hear the bellâ€™s ring in the tune of festive carols, provided the creature is within 600 feet of the bell and not deafened. No other creature hears sound coming from the bell. The bell regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
