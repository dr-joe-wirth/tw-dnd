You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within <<reach 10>> of the whip, with an <<melee Whip +9>>. On a hit, the target takes <<force 1d6+5>>. As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after <<time 1h>>, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are [[Incapacitated]] or die.
