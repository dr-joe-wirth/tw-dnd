While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for <<time 1h>> or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you canâ€™t use them again for <<time "1d12 hours">>.
