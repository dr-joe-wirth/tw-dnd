This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend <<time 48>> over a period of <<time "&le;6d">> studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
