You know the [[Thaumaturgy]] cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[Hellish Rebuke]] spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
