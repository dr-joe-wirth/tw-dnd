''Devil's Sight.'' Magical darkness doesn't impede the lemure's darkvision.
''Hellish Rejuvenation.'' A lemure that dies in the Nine Hells comes back to life with all it's hit points in 1d10 days unless it is killed by a goodÂ·aligned creature with a [[Bless]] spell cast on that creature or its remains are sprinkled with holy water.
