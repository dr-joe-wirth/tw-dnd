"""
''Lightning Absorption.'' Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.
"""
<<divider>>
''Multiattack.'' The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is [[Grappled]] (<<skillcheck Escape 14>>), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.

| !Engulf|The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature [[Grappled]] by it. The engulfed target is [[Blinded]], [[Restrained]], and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a <<save Con 14>> at the start of each of the moundâ€™s turns or take <<bludgeoning 2d8+4>>. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time. |<|
