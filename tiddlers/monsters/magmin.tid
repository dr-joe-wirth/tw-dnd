"""
''Death Burst.'' When the magmin dies, it explodes in a burst of fire and magma. Each creature within <<sphere 10>> must make a <<save Dex 11>>, taking <fail> <<fire 2d6>></fail>, or <pass> <<halved>></pass>. Flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried in that area are ignited.
''Ignited Illumination.'' As a bonus action, the magmin can set itself ablaze or extinguish its flames. While ablaze, the magmin sheds <<bright 10>> and an additional <<dim 10>>.
