''Elemental Demise.'' If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.
''Innate Spellcasting.'' The djinniâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma, <<skillcheck "Save DC" 17>>, <<casted "Spell To-Hit" +9>>. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''At will:'' [[Detect Evil and Good]], [[Detect Magic]], [[Thunderwave]]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''3/day each:'' [[Create Food and Water]] (can create wine instead of water), [[Tongues]], [[Wind Walk]]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''1/day each:'' [[Conjure Elemental]] (<<mob "Air Elemental">> only), [[Creation]], [[Gaseous Form]], [[Invisibility]], [[Major Image]], [[Plane Shift]]
"""
<<divider>>
''Multiattack.'' The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

| !Create Whirlwind|A <<cylinder 5>>, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within <<range 120>> of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a <<save Str 18>> or be [[Restrained]] by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to <<range 60>> as an action, and creatures [[Restrained]] by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>A creature can use its action to free a creature [[Restrained]] by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a <<skillcheck Str 18>>. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [[Restrained]] and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind. |<|
