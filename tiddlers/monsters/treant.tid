| !Animate Trees|''1/Day.''<br/>The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within <<range 60>> of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they canâ€™t speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for <<time 1d>> or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than <<range 120>> from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible. |<|
