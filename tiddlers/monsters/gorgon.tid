| !Petrifying Breath|''Recharge 5â€“6''<br/>The gorgon exhales petrifying gas in a <<cone 30>>. Each creature in that area must succeed on a <<save Con 13>>. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is [[Restrained]]. The [[Restrained]] target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is [[Petrified]] until freed by the [[Greater Restoration]] spell or other magic. |<|
