"""
''Stench.'' Any creature that starts its turn within <<range 5>> of the ghast must succeed on a <<save Con 10>> or be [[Poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the ghastâ€™s Stench for <<time 24h>>.
''Turning Defiance.'' The ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
