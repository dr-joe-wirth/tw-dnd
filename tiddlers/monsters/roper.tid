"""
''False Appearance.'' While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.
''Grasping Tendrils.'' The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (<<ac 20>>; <<hp 10>>; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a <<skillcheck Str 15>> against it.
''Spider Climb.'' The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
"""
<<divider>>
''Multiattack.'' The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.

|~|The target is [[Grappled]] (<<skillcheck Escape 15>>). Until the grapple ends, the target is [[Restrained]] and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper canâ€™t use the same tendril on another target. |<|
| !Reel|The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 feet straight toward it. |<|
