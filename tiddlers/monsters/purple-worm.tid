|~|If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a <<save Dex 19>> or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [[Blinded]] and [[Restrained]], it has [[Total Cover]] against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes <<acid 6d6>> at the start of each of the wormâ€™s turns.<br/>&nbsp<br/>If the worm takes <<damage 30>> or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a <<save Con 21>> at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[Prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[Restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone. |<|
