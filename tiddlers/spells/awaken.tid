After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a huge or smaller beast or plant. 
The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a humanâ€™s. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree. 

The awakened beast or plant is [[Charmed]] by you for 30 days or until you and your companions do anything harmful to it. When the [[Charmed]] condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.
