YOUR SPELLBOOK\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\n\n''Copying a Spell into the Book.'' When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\n\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n\n''Replacing the Book.'' You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\n\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\n\n''The Book’s Appearance.'' Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n","title":"About Spellbooks","tags":"[[Wizard Spellcasting]]","modified":"20210809231337551","created":"20210726031150589"},{"text":"A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid.

The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. \n\n''Spells.'' Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. \n\n''Magic Items.'' The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. Forexample, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be supressed as soon as it exits. \n\n''Magical Travel.'' Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells, temporarily closes while in the sphere. \n\n''Creatures and Objects.'' A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer withinthe sphere. \n\n''Dispel Magic.''

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.\n\n!!! Spell Slots\n\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\n\n!!! Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n!!! Spellcasting Ability\n\n''Charisma'' is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n''Spell save DC'' = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n''Spell attack modifier'' = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n!!!

See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell list.\n\n!!! Cantrips\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\n\n!!! Preparing and Casting Spells\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n!!! Spellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n\"\"\"\n''Spell save DC ='' 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n''Spell attack modifier ='' your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\"\"\"\n\n!!! Ritual Casting\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n!!!

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. \n\n<b>Part Water</b> \nYou cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. \n\n<b>Redirect Flow</b>&nbsp;\nYou cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions.

Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n''Comet.'' If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n''Donjon.'' You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n''Euryale.'' The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n''The Fates.'' Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n''Flames.'' A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n''Fool.'' You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n''Gem.'' Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n''Idiot.'' Permanently reduce your Intelligence by <<roll 1d4+1>> (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n''Jester.'' You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n''Key.'' A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\n''Knight.'' You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n''Moon.'' You are granted the ability to cast the [[Wish]] spell <<roll 1d3>> times.\n\n''Rogue.'' A nonplayer character of the DM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.\n\n''Ruin.'' All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n''Skull.'' You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.\n\n''Star.'' Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.\n\n''Sun.'' You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\n''Talons.'' Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish.\n\n''Throne.'' You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\n''Vizier.'' At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\n''The Void.'' This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\n\n!!! Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, ''choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell)''. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n!!! Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n''Spell save DC ='' 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n''Spell attack modifier ='' your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n!!! Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n!!!

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\n* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.\n\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the Weapons section.\n","title":"Martial Arts","tags":"Ability Monk","modified":"20210820154329867","level":"1","created":"20190621172015678"},{"text":"Typically found in <<roll 1d4>> pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\n\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\n\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\n\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\n\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\n","title":"Marvelous Pigments","tags":"DMG [[Magic Item]] [[Very Rare]]","modified":"20210815035700645","created":"20210814021833972"},{"text":"You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\n","title":"Mask of Many Faces","tags":"Ability [[Eldritch Invocation]] None","modified":"20210823054143398","created":"20190514071828391"},{"text":"Mason’s tools allow you to craft stone structures, including walls and buildings crafted from brick.\n\n''Components.''

You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\n\nAt the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\n\nBecause the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.\n\nThis spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction.

Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\n\nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\n\n* ''Statistics for Objects''. When time is a factor, objects can be assigned these statistics. Use your best judgement; a pick can chip away at stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. \n** Armor Class\n** Hit Points\n** Damage Resistance\n** Damage Immunity. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage.\n** Damage Vulnerability\n*** Bludgeoning works well for smashing things, but not for cutting rope or leather.\n*** Fire or lightning work well against paper or cloth objects.\n** Damage Threshold\n*** An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points.\n* ''Huge and Gargantuan Objects''\n** Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder.\n** Instead of tracking hit points, simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it.\n** If tracking hit points, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. \n*** Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\n\n!!

Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\n\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\n\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.\n\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n\n# ''Red.'' The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n\n# ''Orange.'' The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\n\n# ''Yellow.'' The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n\n# ''Green.'' The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n\n# ''Blue.'' The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n\n# ''Indigo.'' On a failed save, the creature is [[Restrained]]. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n\n# ''Violet.'' On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for ist effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish.

If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.\nIf the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.\nYou can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.","type":"","title":"Telekinesis","tags":"PHB Spell SRD","source":"PHB SRD","school":"Transmutation","save":"","ritual":"No","range":"60 feet","modified":"20210809225958643","level":"5","effect":"","duration":"10 minutes","created":"20190530071945823","concentration":"Yes","components":"V, S","classes":"[[Sorcerer]] [[Wizard]]","casting_time":"1 Action","at_higher_level":""},{"text":"You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\n<b>On Target</b>\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\n<b>Off Target\n</b>You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\n<b>Similar Area\n</b>You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\n<b>Mishap\n</b>The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).","type":"","title":"Teleport","tags":"PHB Spell SRD","source":"PHB SRD","school":"Conjuration","save":"","ritual":"No","range":"10 feet","modified":"20210809230034878","level":"7","effect":"","duration":"Instantaneous","created":"20190721135551844","concentration":"No","components":"V","classes":"[[Bard]] [[Sorcerer]] [[Wizard]]","casting_time":"1 Action","at_higher_level":""},{"text":"As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you.\nA shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn.

Purpose of a Trap\n\n|^!Alarm |An alarm trap is designed to alert an area’s occupants of intruders. It might cause a bell or a gong to sound. This type of trap rarely involves a saving throw, because the alarm can’t be avoided when the trap goes off. |\n|^!Delay |Some traps are designed to slow down enemies, giving a dungeon’s inhabitants time to mount a defense or flee. The hidden pit is a classic example of this kind of trap. A 10-foot-deep pit usually deals little damage and is easy to escape, but it serves its purpose by impeding intruders. Other examples of delaying traps include collapsing walls, a portcullis that drops from the ceiling, and a locking mechanism that shuts and bars a door. If a delaying trap has moving parts that directly threaten characters when they operate, the characters are usually required to make Dexterity saving throws to avoid harm. |\n|^!Restrain |A restraining trap tries to keep its victims in place, leaving them unable to move. Such traps are often employed in conjunction with regular guard patrols, so that victims are periodically extricated and taken away to be dealt with. But in an ancient dungeon, the guards might be long gone.<br/> Restraining traps usually require a successful Strength saving throw to be avoided, but some don’t allow saving throws. In addition to dealing damage, a restraining trap also renders a creature unable to move. Making a subsequent successful Strength check (using the trap’s saving throw DC) or dealing damage against the trap can break it and free the captive. Examples include a bear trap, a cage that drops from a ceiling, and a device that flings a net. |\n|^!Slay |Some traps are designed to eliminate intruders, plain and simple. Their effects include poisoned needles that spring out when a lock is tampered with, blasts of fire that fill a room, poison gas, and other lethal measures. Saving throws — usually Dexterity or Constitution — allow creatures to avoid or mitigate the trap’s effects. |\n\n!! Elements of a Trap\n\n|^!Level and Threat |^A trap’s level is actually a range of levels, equivalent to one of the tiers of play (levels 1–4, 5–10, 11–16, and 17–20), indicating the appropriate time to use the trap in your campaign. Additionally, each trap poses either a moderate, dangerous, or deadly threat, based on its particular details. |\n|^!Detection |Most traps allow either a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to detect their triggers or other elements that can tip off their presence. If you stop to ask players for this information, they might suspect a hidden danger. |\n|^!Trigger |^A simple trap activates when an event occurs that triggers it. This entry in a trap’s description gives the location of the trigger and the activity that causes the trap to activate. |\n|^!Effect |A trap’s effect occurs after it activates. The trap might fire a dart, unleash a cloud of poison gas, cause a hidden enclosure to open, and so on. This entry specifies what the trap targets, its attack bonus or saving throw DC, and what happens on a hit or a failed saving throw. |\n|^!Countermeasures |Traps can be detected or defeated in a variety of ways by using ability checks or magic. This entry in a trap’s description gives the means for counteracting the trap. It also specifies what happens, if anything, on a failed attempt to disable it. |\n\n!!! Complex Traps\n\n|^!Initiative |A complex trap takes turns as a creature does, because it functions over a period of time. This part of a trap’s description tells whether the trap is slow (acts on initiative count 10), fast (acts on initiative count 20), or very fast (acts on initiative count 20 and also initiative count 10). A trap always acts after creatures that have the same initiative count. |\n|^!Active Elements |On a trap’s turn, it produces specific effects that are detailed in this part of its description. The trap might have multiple active elements, a table you roll on to determine its effect at random, or options for you to choose from. |\n|^!Dynamic Elements |A dynamic element is a threat that arises or evolves while the trap functions. Usually, changes involving dramatic elements take effect at the end of each of the trap’s turns or in response to the characters’ actions. |\n|^!Constant Elements |A complex trap poses a threat even when it is not taking its turn.

The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the \"Activity While Traveling\" section later in this chapter for more information).\n\n''Forced March.'' The [[Travel Pace Table]] assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion. \n\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the ''Hour column'' for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10+ 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).\n\n''Mounts and Vehicles.'' For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10\nmiles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\n\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter 5),and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace, Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day,\n\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly, The Dungeon Master's Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.\n\n<<include \"Travel Pace Table\">>\n","title":"Travel Pace","tags":"Rule Movement","order":"6","modified":"20210812063638150","created":"20190710113845254"},{"text":"| !Distance Traveled per . . . |<|<|<|<|\n| !Pace | !Minute | !Hour | !Day | !Effect |\n| !Fast | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |\n| !Normal | 300 feel | 3 miles | 24 miles |&mdash; |\n| !Slow | 200 feel | 2 miles | 18 miles |Able lo use stealth |\n","title":"Travel Pace Table","tags":"Table [[Travel Pace]]","modified":"20190710114504441","created":"20190710114203789"},{"text":"\"\"\"\n''False Appearance.''

On a 01–25, a <<mob Rhinoceros>> appears; on a 26–50, an <<mob Elephant>> appears; and on a 51–100, a <<mob Rat>> appears. See the Monster Manual for the animal’s statistics. |\n| !37–46 |You cast [[Lightning Bolt]]. |\n| !47–49 |A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a <<sphere 30>> centered on the target.

If grass is already there, it grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for <<time 1m>>. |\n| !63–65 |An object of the DM’s choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. |\n| !66–69 |You shrink yourself as if you had cast [[Enlarge/Reduce]] on yourself. |\n| !70–79 |You cast [[Fireball]]. |\n| !80–84 |You cast [[Invisibility]] on yourself. |\n| !85–87 |Leaves grow from the target.

Each gem deals <<bludgeoning 1>>, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line. |\n| !91–95 |A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a <<sphere 30>>. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a <<save Con 15>> or become [[Blinded]] for <<time 1m>>. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. |\n| !96–97 |The target’s skin turns bright blue for <<roll 1d10>> days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected. |\n| !98–00 |If you targeted a creature, it must make a <<save Con 15>>. If you didn’t target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly [[Petrified]]. On any other failed save, the target is [[Restrained]] and begins to turn to stone. While [[Restrained]] in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [[Petrified]] on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the [[Greater Restoration]] spell or similar magic. |\n","title":"Wand of Wonder","tags":"[[Magic Item]] Rare Attunement DMG Wand","modified":"20210814184752216","item_type":"Wand","created":"20210205075223388","attunement":"requires attunement by a spellcaster"},{"text":"This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends.\n\nWhile the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.\n* When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\n* You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.\n\n!!!

The Wooden Girl\n!!!From The Faerûn Child’s Book of Fables\n\nThe girl’s name was Eliza and she was brought to life in the puppet-maker’s workshop. Like most girls, Eliza was equipped with limbs and a face and, of course, a heart. The puppet maker, Sophie, crafted Eliza with loving detail. Sophie perched Eliza in the window of the shop, where she could wave to the passers-by and enjoy the\nview of the ocean in the distance.\n\nOn the first morning of Midwinter, Eliza gazed longingly through the window, watching the white caps fold over the sea. Snow began to fall, dotting the shop windows and obscuring her vision. Eliza grew sad and wistful. She wanted to leave the shop, but knew that she could not.\n\nSuddenly the snowdrops on the glass began to melt. A vivid orange glow filled Eliza’s sight. On the other side of the window stood an old man, face shrouded in a torn scarf, holding a candle. ''Elzerina'' was fearful, for Sophie had always told her: wooden girls must stay away from fire. Sophie told Elzerina about the ''wooden snake'' she had crafted as a child. When the snake was brought to life, it slithered toward the hearth, seeking warmth. A stray ember ignited the snake, and it withered to ashes. This was not the only warning; Sophie also told Elzerina about the set of ''pick-up sticks'' she had crafted when she was the woodworker’s apprentice. Pleased with her\nwork, Sophie rubbed two sticks together to sand away the splinters — but the friction sparked, and the sticks burnt to cinders.\n\nBut the man’s flame was low on the wick, and he peered at her through the glass. //Little wooden girl, why are you so sad?//\n\n//I wish to see the sea beyond this pane of glass, she said. When it snows, the drops blur the window, and I feel trapped.//\n\n//What if I took you from your mount? he said. Would you like that?//\n\nElzerina frowned. //My maker warned me not to go outside, for I could get lost. She says little girls like me get lost in big cities.//\n\nBut the man persisted. //Surely she did not create you just to keep you trapped here forever. What if you fetched her a gift for the holiday?//\n\nThis filled Elzerina with joy. //Oh, yes! I should so love to bring my maker a present. And perhaps I will get a quick glimpse of the sea.//\n\nHe stepped into the shop and lifted her from her mount. He marched through the city and she reveled in the freedom. But he strode not to the sea, but toward the ''City of the Dead''.\n\nIt was not the coovl blue ocean she eventually saw before her, but a scene awash in gray. Perhaps if she blurred her sight, she could pretend that the feeble sun glinting off of the snow-slick tombstones was the white-capped surface of the sea. But Elzerina knew already that she had made a terrible mistake. She suddenly longed for the puppet-maker’s workshop, for the stoic company of ''alphabet blocks'' and sets of dice and intricately-carved spinning tops and tiny ballerinas who danced but never spoke. The man wove through the rows of stones and sat at a ''circle embedded in the ground, an altar unmarked and unnamed''. But it had been desecrated already;\nElzerina saw the remnants of a fire that once burned, the debris of used tinder.\n\nThe man pulled away his scarf and grinned at her, an evil smile matched by red eyes that glinted with sadistic pleasure. He placed her atop the ashes and pulled a matchbook from his shabby coat pocket. He had the tool but not the fuel &mdash; until he had found the wooden girl in the workshop window, made from the choicest wood for burning, the perfect size for kindle on a long winter night.\n\nThe man struck an oiled match tip and the flame roared to life, a curious gradient of deep navy and violent orange. And as the blue heart of the flame engulfed her, Eliza thought of both the azure sea she would never meet and the puppet-maker’s kind cornflower eyes, and longed for their cool, ''dousing touch''.\n","title":"Winter's Splendor - The Wooden Girl","tags":"[[Winter's Splendor]] Section","order":"10","modified":"20210813024124644","created":"20210812133626773","caption":"The Wooden Girl"},{"text":"The Cassalanter parents appear to be outwardly charitable, but they are involved in a much larger plot to pay off <<per Asmodeus>> and regain control over their childrens’ souls.\n\n|top|k\n|!Alignment |Lawful Evil |\n|!Statblock |<<mob Commoner>> |\n|!Reference |See {{WDH||Link}} pages 193 & 218 |\n|!Pronunciation |Ah-MAH-lee-ah, Vick-TORE-oh |\n|!Personality |We maintain a warm, if somewhat distant, demeanor.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\n\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\n* You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\n* You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n\n* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n\n* You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your com panions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n\n* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire mightonlybepartlyachieved,oryoumightsuffersome unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.","type":"","title":"Wish","tags":"PHB Spell SRD","source":"PHB SRD","school":"Conjuration","save":"","ritual":"No","range":"Self","modified":"20210809230743225","level":"9","glyph_target":"<<self>>","glyph_range":"<<na>>","glyph_effect":"Various effects.","glyph_duration":"<<instant>>","glyph_casting_time":"<<action>>","effect":"","duration":"Instantaneous","created":"20190721140814244","concentration":"No","components":"V","classes":"[[Sorcerer]] [[Wizard]]","casting_time":"1 Action","at_higher_level":""},{"text":"''Prerequisite:'' 15th level\n\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.\n","title":"Witch Sight","tags":"Ability [[Eldritch Invocation]] 15th","modified":"20210823054143405","created":"20190514090042003"},{"text":"As a wizard, you gain the following class features.\n\n!!!

See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.\n\n!!! Cantrips\n\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\n!!! Spellbook\n\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\n!!! Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n!!! Spellcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n''Spell save DC ='' 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n''Spell attack modifier ='' your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n!!! Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.\n\n!!! Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\n!!! Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\n\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).\n\n{{About Spellbooks}}\n\n","title":"Wizard Spellcasting","tags":"Ability Wizard","modified":"20210823131038808","level":"1","created":"20190411121906890","caption":"Spellcasting"},{"text":"<<htabs \"[tag[Wizard Spells]sort[order]]\">>\n","title":"Wizard Spells","tags":"[[Spells By Class]] Wizard","modified":"20210809153814237","created":"20190612154331897"},{"text":"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","type":"image/gif","title":"wizard.gif","tags":"Image","modified":"20210811055759596","created":"20210811055758194"},{"text":"|max top|k\n| !Level | !PB | !Features | !Cantrips Known | !1st | !2nd | !3rd | !4th | !5th | !6th | !7th | !8th | !9th |\n| !1st | +2 |<<list-abilities 1>> | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !2nd | +2 |<<list-abilities 2>> | 3 | 3 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !3rd | +2 |<<list-abilities 3>> | 3 | 4 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !4th | +2 |<<list-abilities 4>> | 4 | 4 | 3 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !5th | +3 |<<list-abilities 5>> | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !6th | +3 |<<list-abilities 6>> | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !7th | +3 |<<list-abilities 7>> | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !8th | +3 |<<list-abilities 8>> | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — |\n| !9th | +4 |<<list-abilities 9>> | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | — | — | — | — |\n| !10th | +4 |<<list-abilities 10>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — |\n| !11th | +4 |<<list-abilities 11>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | — | — | — |\n| !12th | +4 |<<list-abilities 12>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | — | — | — |\n| !13th | +5 |<<list-abilities 13>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | — |\n| !14th | +5 |<<list-abilities 14>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | — |\n| !15th | +5 |<<list-abilities 15>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | — |\n| !16th | +5 |<<list-abilities 16>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | — |\n| !17th | +6 |<<list-abilities 17>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| !18th | +6 |<<list-abilities 18>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| !19th | +6 |<<list-abilities 19>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| !20th | +6 |<<list-abilities 20>> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |\n","title":"WizardAdvancementTemplate","tags":"Wizard Table Template","subclass":"School of Evocation","modified":"20210823131057322","created":"20191124100020405","class":"Wizard"},{"text":"\"\"\"\n''Keen Hearing and Smell.''
